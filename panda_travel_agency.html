	<h3>Reviews from Real People!</h3>
		<blockquote>User "timgoode48" says: "If you are looking for a unique experience as you visit a grand lighthouse, consider the only "ghost" tour in St. Augustine conducted in a lighthouse. The 291 step climb to the top of the lighthouse yields a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding area. I you happen to be a photographer, you enjoy the opportunity to make some beautiful panoramic photos and great time exposures. The view is well worth the climb."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>User "Jason A" says: "We caught a beautiful clear day and you could see 25 miles! Great exercise getting to the top, but lots to see and do even if you choose not to climb. We watched a very kind gentleman demonstrating boat building who took time to chat and answer our questions. It was also neat to see the lighthouse at night on our "ghost tour."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>User "Renee N" says: "The view is unbeatable! Historians will love all the little anecdotes and preserved memorabilia there, it definitely takes you back in time and gives you a new appreciation for the way people used to live. And we enjoyed this lighthouse as one of our stops on a ghost tour in the evening also. Very spooky, worth the trip."</blockquote>
